# FarmSupervisor-GraduationProject
This repository contains my GraduationProject which is an Android Mobile Application for Palestinian farmers to help them mange their crops by providing recommendations related to weather conditions, pest, disease management and other features explained in the report attached.

# Mobile Application
This application built using Android Studio with Java Programming Language.

It contains two microservices:
# SpringBoot 
This service built with SpringBoot framework in Java. It used PostgreSQL database to manage the data of the users, lands, crops data.

# Django Recommendations Service
This application, which was created with Python's Django framework, stores information about plants—currently, avocados—in a MongoDB database. It offers advice, alerts, and details on illnesses, pests, treatments, and required equipment. The service also takes into account user locations, weather, and plant relationships.
